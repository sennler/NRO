# nro
A fork of the FreeDOS Unix-like utility "NRO". Plans for the future include porting some version of troff for typesetting.

Additions: A set of basic macros, "MERP.NRO", aims to make NRO source files more concise.
To see how to use the MERP macro set, consult MERP1DOC.MAN in the MACRO directory.

"x" formatting macro is missing! Don't worry, more macros are on the way.

Planned Macros:

* subsections
* footnotes
* un-numbered lists

Note: NRO achieves boldfaced text by backspacing to re-type each "bolded" character, much as one would on a typewriter,
so any doubled letters in the .MAN (output) files signifies boldface type.
