        MERP seeks to simplify the process of formatting documents in NRO by 
    providing a simple macro set with sensible defaults and mnemonic 
    commands.  By reducing the formatting commands to single lines, MERP 
    will hopefully stay out of the way.  To use the MERP macro set, simply 
    put ".so MERP.NRO" at the start of your document.  The MERP.NRO file 
    must be in the same directory as the your document (unfortunately) and 
    do not enclose MERP.NRO in quotations of any kind.  What's included in 
    MERP?  We will now go through the entire command set alphabetically and 
    explain what each does.  

    cs - centered section, boldface, and with space above a below to pad it 
        (will be referred to as padded for the rest of the document) 

    ct - centered title, boldface, padded, and begins a new page 

    hi - hanging indent for paragraphs, "n" spaces leftmost of the rest of 
        the paragraph, by which n is the argument supplied (ex: "hi 4" 
        indents 4 spaces).  The default is 2, which makes it identical to 
        ".pn" (paragraph numbering) in form.  The other paragraph commands 
        will line up with the body indent, not the hang 

    ip - indented paragraph, 4 spaces rightmost of the rest of the paragraph 

    nc - numbered and centered section, boldface, and padded.  No new page 
        is started.  For a new page, see ".ct" (centered title) 

        Note: the number register used for ".ns" is different than that used 
        for ".nc", to allow for more flexibility 

    nl - numbered list 

        Note: this is not a limiter/delimiter style macro, and as such, 
        ".nl" is required for each entry in the list.  To reset the counter, 
        see ".rl" (reset list) 

    np - numbered paragraph, which places a boldface number in line with the 
        rest of the paragraph, indenting the text slightly to achieve this.  
        For a hanging number and no indent, see ".pn" (paragraph numbers) 

    ns - numbered section, boldface, padded, and left-aligned 

    nt - numbered title, boldface, centered, padded, and begins a new page 

    pg - page, which sets up page length, header and footer spacing, right 
        margin and left indent, and minimum number of lines needed to 
        prevent a page break 

    pn - paragraph numbering, contrasted with ".np" (numbered paragraph) 
        does not use boldface numbers, instead placing a number to the left 
        of an un-indented paragraph 

    rl - reset list, which sets the list register back to 1

        Note: the ".r*" commands are reset commands, and follow the format 
        of replacing the first letter of the command one wishes to reset the 
        numbering for with an "r", making them easy to remember 

    rn - reset (paragraph) numbering, which sets the paragraph numbering 
        register back to 1 

    rp - reset (numbered) paragraphs, which sets the paragraph numbering 
        register back to 1 

    se - section, boldface, un-numbered, left-aligned, and padded 

    up - un-indented paragraph, which uses the default indent

        For NRO source files, I have adopted the practice of employing the 
    .NRO extension, so as not to confuse them with any other type of file.  
    For the output files, which may be easily viewed using MORE or LESS, I 
    prefer a .MAN extension, to call back to nroff's use in manpages.
