    A pertinent question for any serious user of FreeDOS who might also have 
    an  interest in typesetting is: does FreeDOS allow for the production of
    beautiful documents with the usual  typesetter's  toolbox?    Well,  TeX
    certainly  made  its way onto MS-DOS in the past, but I have yet to test
    emTeX & co., in part because I prefer the simplicity of  groff.    In  a
    broader  sense however, this is one of series of experiments to test and
    push the limits of FreeDOS to see how well  it  can  work  as  a  modern
    operating system.  An important part of an operating system today is the 
    ability  to  send professional looking documents in PDF, and to a lesser
    extent, PostScript form.    This  extends  naturally  to  printing  said
    documents as  well.  Does NRO solve this issue for the users of FreeDOS?
    Well, let us delve into the matter.  


    To start us off is a list of notable  limitations  to  NRO  that  hamper
    one's  ability to produce formatted output rivaling that of WordPerfect,
    WordStar, and other well-known MS-DOS word processors.  

    NNoottaabbllee DDiissccllaaiimmeerr: NRO does an excellent job of replicating the UNIX V7 
    roff "nroff", which by  default  does  not  support  many  of  the  more
    "modern"  options  that GNU's roff "groff" added in order to improve the
    functionality and versatility of the UNIX nroff.  Additionally, if  this
    document  nonetheless sounds overly negative, it's because the positives
    of groff are known to all who would be interested in using NRO  on  DOS.
    Heck,  I wrote this using NRO on FreeDOS, and that ain't cause I dislike
    it.  

    0.  Output Formats 

      This is perhaps the biggest gap in NRO for the  typesetting  inclined.
      One  of  the joys of using a typesetting software is seeing the output
      beautifully  reflected  back  when  printed  or  ported   to   PDF   /
      PostScript.   Unfortunately, NRO does not have the ability to natively
      output either PostScript or PDF,  and  it  is  unlikely  that  such  a
      feature will be added.    What  to  do  about that?  Suffer.  Printing
      everything out is another solution, though a rather poor one at  that.
      Or  maybe  if I acquire the time, skills, and motivation, I might look
      into how  BSD  and  GNU/Linux  accomplished  this,  and  implement  it
      myself.  No  promises  though,  I'm  not exactly a DOS guru yet.  I've
      only used it for a few months at this point.  If you read that  as  me
      being young, you're right on the money.  Don't expect anything soon.  

    1.  Macros 

      There aren't  any  I  could  find.   If someone has NRO macros, please
      share them!  Additional macro functions that would be lovely  to  have
      include: 

        * numbered lists and headers 
        * control lines (spacing) andor comment syntax 
        * font sizing  
        * footnotes

      I  may  get  around to implementing mine own at some point, though far
      more likely is that I will only make macros using already  pre-defined
      NRO functions.  This would mean un-numbered lists and headers, leading 
      and  body  paragraphs,  a title format, underlined links, and not much
      else.  

    2.  Italics (or Emphasis) 

      Without the ability to  use  italics  in  addition  to  and  alongside
      underlining  and  boldfaced  text,  NRO  remains more limited than the
      other commonly used DOS  word  processors.    Again,  I  might  cobble
      together a way to do this, eventually, though I should stress I am not 
      a competent programmer.  

    3.  Bold / Underline Exclusivity 

      Bolding and underlining text are mutually exclusive features.  This is 
      an  unfortunate  truth  of how NRO works, and if I may speculate as to
      the reason, it was likely easier to implement this way and  not  worth
      the  effort  for the typical use case for groff and nroff: writing and
      rendering manpages.  On the upside, those manaics who feel inclined to 
      use bold italicized and underlined text in large fonts  are  currently
      prevented  from  abusing  that  feature  as  provided  on  other  word
      processing and typesetting software.  This sort of person is  unlikely
      to be  user  of groff however, making it a moot point.  Don't worry, I
      used to be one of these people a few years ago.    I'm  not  attacking
      those who do, merely criticizing poor taste.

      know, and I'll fix it as soon as I get time.  And should this document 
      seem terribly done from the view of an experienced *roff user, I offer 
      my sincerest apologies.  I'm still learning it.
